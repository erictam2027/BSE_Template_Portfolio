Ball Tracking Robot
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

# Starter project



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5sS4r5BRks8?si=SgCfxLQdLVn6RgoO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For my starter project, I chose the arduino starter project, which allows for an imput and an output. When building my configurations, I chose the button input, allowing me to press the button and outputting the LEDs that I chose. There were 2 lights in my modification, one that turned on when button was pressed, and the other turned on when the button wasnt pressed. Overall, it was quite challenging for me because I ran into many issues and errors along the way and even had to rebuild my proto shield. The soldering caused many issues and many unknown problems were in the board, causing me to have to rebuild the entire thing. Overall, I still recommend doing this project because you would learn everything you wouldn't know without doing this project and this was a great learning experience. Also, you choose try and modify your inputs and outputs to absorb the most out of it, however, I believe the tutorials didn't teach a lot, requiring me to trial and error.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
